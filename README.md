# NodeEmbedding4j

A lightweight, modular Java library for random-walk–based node embeddings, focused on clean API design and research experimentation.

---

## Status

🚧 **Early draft / design exploration**

This repository contains an initial implementation that emphasizes architecture and modularity rather than feature completeness or performance optimization.  
APIs and internal components may change significantly.

---

## Overview

NodeEmbedding4j is an exploratory Java library for learning node embeddings from graphs using random walks and Skip-Gram–style objectives.

The goal of the project is **not** to provide a production-ready framework, but to explore a clean and extensible design that separates the main conceptual stages of random-walk–based embedding pipelines.

---

## Design Principles

The library is organized around clear separation of concerns:

- **Walk generation**  
  Responsible for producing node sequences from a graph (e.g., random walks, path-based walks).

- **Context modeling**  
  Extracts positive (target, context) relationships from walks using sliding-window strategies.

- **Negative sampling**  
  Generates negative samples from the global node universe while respecting forbidden contexts.

- **Dataset construction**  
  Assembles positive and negative samples into training-ready datasets.

This modular design allows components to be swapped or extended independently.

---

## Intended Use

- Research prototyping
- Algorithmic exploration
- Educational purposes
- Design experimentation for graph embedding pipelines

This project is **not** intended to compete with established graph embedding frameworks.

---

## Current Scope

At this stage, the library focuses on:

- Index-based node representations
- Random-walk–driven context generation
- Symmetric sliding-window models
- Uniform negative sampling

Advanced optimizations, benchmarks, and extensive model support are intentionally out of scope for the current draft.

---

## Future Work

Potential future directions (non-committal):

- Additional walk strategies
- Alternative context models
- Degree-biased or adaptive negative sampling
- Integration with learning objectives and optimizers
- Documentation and examples

Development pace will depend on available time and research priorities.
